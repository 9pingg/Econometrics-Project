# Econometrics-Project
Repo includes two assignments, and the final project which were given in the Econometrics course.

# About the Project 
  The purpose of this project is to empirically test the relationship between agricultural growth on a health indicator.
  We were free to choose a particular health indicator from the various given by the instructor. And to find the impact of agricultural growth on health     outcomes to change over time, and if the regression model's account for such a change.

  Here we model the health indicator as a function of set of independent variables such as agricultural yield in a particular year of a particular state.
